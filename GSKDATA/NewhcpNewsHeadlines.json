Karanicolas' project, \"Using Deep Learning to Enable Rational Design of Molecular Glues,\" aims to develop machine learning tools for identifying compounds that stabilize select protein interactions. If successful, the studies will provide a necessary shift away from techniques that simply hope to find molecular glues by serendipity and move instead towards rational design methods that will enable much broader applications.

However, some environmental and conservation groups view it as an expensive and unproven solution. The clock is ticking as the United States aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2035. Gordon hopes CCUS can prove its viability by the end of the decade and prevent job losses in the energy sector.

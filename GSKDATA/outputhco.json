This protocol, aimed at early detection of clinical deterioration, was put into practice from July 2021 to December 2023 in the hospital's Unit C. It involves scoring patients based on predefined criteria such as oxygen saturation, respiratory and heart rates, and body temperature, to identify those at risk of health deterioration and prevent cardiopulmonary arrest. The implementation has led to a significant reduction in emergency codes being triggered, with a 48% decrease in the activation of the Code Red for early deterioration risk and no need to activate the Code Blue for cardiopulmonary arrest in the last four months of the project. The initiative has been deemed a success, with the protocol now firmly integrated into the routine practices of all professionals in the unit.",

Around the age of 5, after stabilizing her asthmatic crises, she was able to start running and playing, significantly improving her quality of life. Her mother, Ra\u00edssa, faced significant emotional and financial challenges during this period, including being fired for missing work to take care of Giovana. The experience led Ra\u00edssa to create an NGO to support other families facing similar problems.
